* TODOs

** Frontend
- Fix buying
- Implement screen for adding stuff to vending machine (as buyer)

** Protection of API
- Add Gatekeeper in front of frontend and backend.
- Add interceptor that reads JWT.

** User management
Using Keycloak and Keycloak Gatekeeper.

Single session is possible using Keycloak's Session Count Limiter. See
https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-documentation/blob/main/server_admin/topics/authentication/flows.adoc.

*** Ideas:
- Connect with blockchain using https://github.com/susimsek/keycloak-blockchain-user-federation
